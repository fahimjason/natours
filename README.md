# FAQ for my Advanced CSS Project

This repo contains starter files and the finished project files for all the project.

Use starter code to start each section, and **final code to compare it with your own code whenever something doesn't work**!

ðŸ‘‡ **_Please read the following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) carefully before starting the codes** ðŸ‘‡

## FAQ

### Q1: How do I download the files?

**A:** If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the entire code, hit the green button saying "Code", and then choose the "Download ZIP" option.

### Q2: One of the NPM packages is not working (compiling Sass, live-reload, etc). How to fix it?

Unfortunately, this is quite common. I listed some possible fixes [in this document](npm-fixes.md).

### Q3: I'm stuck in one of the projects. Where do I get help?

**A:** Have you actually tried to fix the problem on your own? Have you compared your code to the final code? If you failed fixing your problem, please **try to solved from google at first. If you can't please post a detailed description of the problem to any social media group**.

### Q4: Can I see a final version of the project?

**A:** Sure, I have an online version. Here they are: [Natours](https://natours-fahim.netlify.app) (advanced CSS, Sass and responsive design).

### Q5: I want to put these project in my portfolio. Is that allowed?

**A:** Absolutely! Just make sure you actually built them yourself by following the codes, and that you understand what you did.

### Q6: Do you accept pull requests?

**A:** No, for the simple reason that I want this repository to contain the _exact_ same code that I did. However, please feel free to add an issue if you found one.
